# load the "shiny" library

library("shiny") 

# Define a new `ui` variable. This variable should be assigned a `fluidPage` layout


  # Include a `titlePanel` layout with the text "Cost Calculator"


  # Include a `numericInput()` widget with the label "Price (in dollars)"
  # It should have a default value of 0 and a minimum value of 0
  # Hint: look up the function in the documentation!


  # Include a `numericInput()` widget with the label "Quantity"
  # It should have a default value of 1 and a minimum value of 1


  # Include the word "Cost" strongly bolded


  # Include a `textOutput()` output of the calculated `cost`



# Define a `server` function (with appropriate arguments)


  # Assign a reactive `renderText()` function to the outputted `cost`
  # The reactive expression should return the inputed `price` times the `quantity`
  # So it looks nice, paste a "$" in front of it!




# Create a new `shinyApp()` using the above ui and server
